# Use DEVKIT 
Refer OPL1000-DEVKIT-getting-start-guide.pdf under "Doc" folder to know how to use DEVKIT board.  

# Evaluate OPL1000 functionality 
Refer OPL1000-AT-instruction-set-and-examples.pdf to know how to use AT command to evaluate OPL1000 features. Please download "opl1000_at.bin" firmware under FW_Binary folder and execute AT command to understand OPL1000 functionality.

# Download firmware  
- Refer OPL1000-patch-download-tool-user-guide.pdf under "Doc" folder to know how to download firmware. 
- If DEVKIT board AT UART port cannot work, please install USB driver according to "OPL1000-DEVKIT-getting-start-guide" document section 3.1 

# Define external peripheral resource
Refer OPL1000-pinmux-tool-user-guide.pdf under "Doc" folder to know how to configure OPL1000 external peripheral resource. 

# Compiling user application project
Refer OPL1000-SDK-getting-start-guide.pdf and OPL1000-SDK-Development-guide.pdf to understand how to develop own application. 

# Development tool 
User can use two methods to develop application. 

- use Keil uVision 5 on Windows system. "opl1000_app_m3.uvprojx" project file is provided for each individual example under SDK\APS_PATCH\examples folder. User can open it by KeilC and add own function freely.     
- use GNU arm GCC tool. "Makefile" is provided for each individual example under SDK\APS_PATCH\examples folder. User can use Make tool to compile and link own application. How to install GCC development environment under Windows system please refer chapter4 of "OPL1000-SDK-Development-guide.pdf" document.
